;; These 'new' statements create an instance of classes that define Lisp functionality.
;; The packages are loaded in alphabetic order, there is no specific need to load them
;; in this order. For most special forms, the interpreter and compiler definition is in the same
;; source file. Let and Let* are in the same source file. The and TheCompiler are separate because
;; the interpreted version (The.java) is used by the interpreter.
;; All of these classes are based on Definer which scans for annotations in the constructor.
;; When @DefineLisp annotations are found attached to a method it is saved in a Symbol FunctionCell,
;; where the interpreter and compiler can find it.
